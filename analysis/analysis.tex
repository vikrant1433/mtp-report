\subsection{How does GPS works ?}
Before we dig deep into the analysis GPS thing lets first understand how does GPS works?

As we know that GPS works on the principle of trilateration which means that if we
want to find out the location of a point in space and we know that it lies in three
planes then we can uniquely find out this point. Yes you guessed it right it the
point of intersection of all three planes. But in practice
